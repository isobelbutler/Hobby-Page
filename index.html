          The iconic Sea to Sea (known as the C2C) Route will guide you 227 km from the edge of the Irish Sea to the North Sea. Starting in Whitehaven, you will pass through some of the UK’s most stunning scenery such as the Lake District National Park, the Eden Valley, and the Pennines, before arriving in Tyneside.

                  After dipping your wheel in the Irish Sea at the harbour ramp near The Beacon, 
                  set off from Whitehaven harbour following the National Cycle Network Signs (NCN), 
                  until you join the old railway line which takes you all the way to Rowrah. Skirt 
                  around Lamplugh Fell to the east side of Loweswater where you then turn left 
                  along the River Cocker before tackling your main hill of the day at Whinlatter. 
                  Stay on the main road all the way up the hill to the Whinlatter Forest café at 
                  the top, then follow the road down the other side to Braithwaite. From here it’s 
                  a short ride to the beautiful market town of Keswick, a top spot for lunch. The 
                  route has been resigned and diverted out of Keswick and now takes you up past 
                  Castlerigg Stone Circle. Follow the route from here onto the north side of the 
                  A66 to Mungrisdale and on to Greystoke. Cross over the top of the M6 motorway 
                  and follow the route into town and to your overnight destination of Penrith.

                From Penrith you will see the North Pennine hills in front of you to the east, 
                that’s where you’re heading today! Follow the NCN out of Penrith, over the 
                iron bridge at Langwathby. In the village the route heads off to your left 
                towards Renwick and onwards to the long climb which takes you over Hartside. Stop 
                at Hartside and check out the views . There are some stunning views looking 
                west on a clear day. From here it’s pretty much downhill all the way down the 
                road to Garrigill. More steep climbs out of Garrigill (20%) and then head over
                 the top to Nenthead (25% downhill). There’s a nice coffee shop in Nenthead and 
                 also a bike repair shop. From Nenthead it’s a roller coaster of a ride with 
                 several climbs and descents through stunning countryside to Allenheads, 
                 Rookhope and finally Stanhope. Keep an eye out for the disused lead mines 
                 and old railway tracks.

                Your day starts with a tough climb directly out of Stanhope, there’s two 
                defibrillators placed at strategic points on the hill! Near the top of 
                the hill keep an eye out for the right turnoff along the track to Parkhead 
                station to join the old Waskerley Way railway line. After that it’s pretty 
                much downhill all the way to Consett. Take the turn off to your left 
                to Derwent Park and to the River Tyne at Swalwell. From there follow the river, 
                keeping it on your left until you reach the Millenium Bridge in the centre of 
                Newcastle, cross over this bridge and start following the signs for the NCN 72 or 
                NCN 1 downstream staying on the north of the river to Tynemouth Castle. Continue 
                along the promenade by the river and at the end ride up a short incline and you 
                will see the castle in front of you. The finish is at the Tynemouth Sailing Club 
                by the north pier.
